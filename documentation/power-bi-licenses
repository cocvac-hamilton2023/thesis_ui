For the duration of this project, we utilized a free license. However, [seperate licenses](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) exist. These include Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium. We were limited in regards to what we could do during the project because we did not have a budget, but if a budget for these specific licenses. Below are some recommendations for the future of the project there was budget in the future. Note: Power BI has [seperate pricing for non-profits](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/power-bi).

We were most limited in this project by our free license because it meant that we could not work with the [APIs from Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/). Due to the licensing requirements, we were unable to work with any of the [Power BI Embedded Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/). 

One way around this licensing constraint is to create a [Microsoft Developer Account](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).
