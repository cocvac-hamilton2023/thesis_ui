## License Overview
For the duration of this project, we utilized a free license. However, [different licenses](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) exist. These include Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium. We were limited in regards to what we could do during the project because we did not have a budget, but if a budget for these specific licenses. Below are some recommendations for the future of the project there was budget in the future. Note: Power BI has  [separate pricing for non-profits](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/power-bi).

## Limitations

We were most limited in this project by our free license because it meant that we could not work with the [APIs from Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/) and [Power BI Embedded Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/). 

## Microsoft Developer Account

One way around this licensing constraint is to create a  [Microsoft Developer Account](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).  This is something that we considered utilizing. We even set up a developer account, but later decided against this since according to the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program FAQ Section](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq) "Your subscription is good for 90 days and is renewable based on valid developer activity. If you're using your subscription for development, it will be renewed regularly." The requirement of consistently having valid developer activity ultimately was the reason we decided to forgo this option. We knew that there would be valid developer activity during the Fall 2023 Semester, but understood that after our thesis semester was complete there might not be enough valid developer activity. We did not want our clients to lose access to our work when our developer account stopped being renewed so we ultimately chose another method of completing the project. However, if developer activity were to be resumed in the future, utilizing a developer account could be a viable option.
