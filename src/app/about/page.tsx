        Hi, I am a senior computer science major at Hamilton College. I am
        interested in full-stack development and will be moving to Portland,
        Oregon upon graduation to work as a software engineer at Nike. My
        favorite coding language is Python and outside of computer science
        classes, I enjoy talking environmental studies classes. At school, you
        can typically find me climbing at the school&apos;s rock wall, holed up
        in the science center coding, or cycling around the farms nearby
        Hamilton&apos;s campus.

        Hi, I&apos;m also a senior computer science major at Hamilton College,
        and I am a minor in Africana Studies. I grew up in central New Jersey. I
        am interested in doing UX Design or software engineering after I
        graduate. At Hamilton, I&apos;ve enjoyed taking introductory classes to
        explore the other departments. Some activities I enjoy are playing
        cello, swimming, and playing pickleball. I also love trying new sports
        and activities.

        Hi! I am also a senior computer science major at Hamilton College, and
        I&apos;m a minor in History. I am from Northern California, and I&apos;m
        looking forward to working as a software engineer in San Francisco after
        graduation. I enjoy reading and hiking, and I love learning new
        languages as well. I&apos;m very interested in software engineering and
        database design, and outside of computer science I enjoy taking history
        and philosophy courses.
