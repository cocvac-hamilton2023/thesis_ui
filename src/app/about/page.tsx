        Hi, I am a senior computer science major at Hamilton College. I am
        interested in full-stack development and will be moving to Portland,
        Oregon upon graduation to work as a software engineer at Nike. My
        favorite coding language is Python and outside of computer science
        classes, I enjoy talking environmental studies classes. At school, you
        can typically find me climbing at the school&apos;s rock wall, holed up
        in the science center coding, or cycling around the farms nearby
        Hamilton&apos;s campus.

        Hi, I'm also senior computer science major at Hamilton College, and I
        minor in Africana Studies. I grew up in central New Jersey. I am
        interested in doing UX Design or software engineering after I graduate.
        At Hamilton, I've enjoyed taking introductory classes to explore the
        other departments. Some activities I enjoy are playing cello, swimming,
        and playing pickleball. I also love trying new sports and activities.
